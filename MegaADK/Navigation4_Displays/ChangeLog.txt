					Added BMSerial ports for the SSC-32 and RoboClaw 2x5 controllers;
						defined a Motor struct to hold information about motors; added motor
						definitions and initialization; modified moveServoPw() and moveServoDegrees()
						to work with a BMSerial port.

					Converted to using a BMSerial() port for the hardware serial console port

					Converted to running the RoboClaw 2x5 motor controller in Packet Serial mode,
						with all the goodies - encoders, speed, acceleration, and distance.

					Modified moveServoPw() and moveServoDegrees() to use a pointer to the port

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.1.7 ALPHA 13-Jan-2014:
					Added ColorSensor struct for RGB color sensor data; added code to read the TCS34725
						RGB color and TMP006 heat sensors.

					Added a control pin (COLOR_SENSOR_LED, pin 4) so the LED can be turned on and off.

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.1.8 ALPHA 15-Jan 2014:
					Fixed a bug in readPING() - was not getting the duration, because code was in a comment.

					Now displaying readings from all sensors in the main loop. RGB color and Heat sensors are
						working. IMU seems to be working so far - still need to get useful information from it.

					The SSC-32 doesn't seem to like SoftwareSerial ports.

					I'm thinking more seriously about moving to the Arduino Mega ADK board. There is only about
						5Kb of program memory left, RAM is low, etc. I don't think I have a choice here.

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.1.9 ALPHA 18-Jan-2014:
					Starting migration from the Arduino (BotBoarduino) to the Arduino Mega ADK board

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.2.0 ALPHA 22-Jan-2014:
					Adding display driver code from IMU_Multi_Display_Test.ino

					I decided to keep the displays, because they can be useful for displaying status and
						error information from the robot.

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.2.1 ALPHA 24-Jan-2014:
					Reorganized code, grouped similar kinds of routines together.

					I discovered the problem with the I2C is with the DFRobots Sensor Shield I have for the
						Arduino Mega ADK board. I removed the shield, rewired everything, and it's all
						working except the DS1307 real time clock. I have another one I can build when I
						get more solder.

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.2.2 ALPHA 26-Jan-2014:
					Added the Hybotics_10DOF_Unified library to get orientation information - pitch, roll,
						and heading from the raw accelerometer and magnetometer (compass) data

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.2.3 Teensy 3.1 ALPHA 09-Feb-2014:
					Beginning converstion to run on the Teensy 3.1 board:

					Set header definitions for the Teensy 3.1 hardware serial ports

					Removed all references to the BMSerial and RoboClaw libraries, because they just aren't
						compatible with the Teensy 3.1 right now. I am not sure how I want to or should proceed
						with this right now.

					Fixed a problem with the Hybotics_10DOF_Unified library where it was not able to find the
						Adafruit_BMP085_Unified.h file. I switched to using my version of this library
						(Hybotics_BMP180_Unified), and everything seems OK - more testing is needed. I should
						probably rename this library to Hybotics_BMP180_Unified to show there are differences
						from the Adafruit version.

					Commented out the code that checks to see if the DS1307 RTC is running, because there is some
						kind of bug in the isrunning() routine that causes it to return a failed check when the rtc
						is running.

					Added delay at the end of the main loop() to allow time to read the Serial Monitor log.

					This version builds cleanly for the Teensy 3.1. Testing begins!
					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.2.4 ALPHA 11-Feb-2014:
					Testing current code with Teensy 3.1 board.

					Minor changes required to bring code into sync with the Arduino Mega ADK code

					I adjusted the display routines a bit to give the combined output a nicer and easier to
						read look.

					The BMP180 Temperature/Pressure sensor is working fine.

					The TCS34725 RGB color and TMP006 heat sensors are working fine.

					The L3GD20 Gyro does not seem to work, apparently it is not detected - commented all Gyro
						related code out. I will look at the Adafruit_L3GD20 library and see if I can find any
						issues.

					I am getting readings from the LSM303DLHC Accelerometer and LSM303DLHC Magnetometer (Compass),
						but am not sure they are correct. More testing and validation is needed.

					-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
					v0.2.5 ALPHA 12-Feb-2014:
					Changed the COLOR_SENSOR_LED from pin 4 to pin 11. Pin 4 conflicted with the
						location of the PING sensors on pins 4 to 6.

					Added the build version, date, and board to the heading announcement.

					I've activated all RoboClaw related code now, and everything builds and loads into the
						Teensy 3.1 now.

					Starting to test Paul's fixes to the BMSerial and RoboClaw libraries. I have communication
						on Serial2 (pins 9, 10) and Serial3 (pins 7, 8) at 115200 with the SSC-32, but nothing
						on Serial (pins 0, 1).

					I've added many console.println() statements to trace how far the code is executing

					This is the version running on my Teensy 3.1 now.
